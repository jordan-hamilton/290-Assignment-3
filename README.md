Assignment 3

This assignment is graded based on correctness and will require you to use higher-order functions to sort automobiles. The description is below and can also be found here  (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.on jsFiddle. You should submit a single .js file called automobile.js which when run with node.js using the command "node automobile.js" produces the described results. You must make use of  higher-order functions to sort the cars. You should not, for example, create entirely separate functions each with dedicated loops to sort the cars. You will need a loop (or potentially more than one loop depending on your sorting algorithm of choice) in the sortArr function but that is pretty much it. Use prototype whenever needed.

When submitting your file must be named "<osu_username>.zip": e.g. iannie.zip. When unzipped the data structure needs to unzip into a folder named "<osu_username>" with automobile.js in it. It must look like the following example:

Before unzip:

some_folder/
|-- iannie.zip

After unzip:

some_folder/
|-- iannie.zip
|-- iannie/
|----- automobile.js

Failure to do this will result in a points deduction. It is a good idea to download what you upload and unzip it to ensure A) everything is there that you expect and B) it is in the correct file structure.
